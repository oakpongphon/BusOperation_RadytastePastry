# Project overview: Optimization of Quant Croissant Production at Rady Tasty Pastry

## Context & Challenge
Rady Tasty Pastry faced a recurring dilemma concerning the production of their popular Quant Croissants â€“ an imbalance between daily production and customer demand, resulting in either surplus pastries or unmet sales opportunities. With each croissant costing $1.25 to produce and selling at $5.00, optimizing the production quantity was crucial to maximize profits and minimize losses. Unsold croissants were partially recuperated through a deal with a charitable organization, buying leftovers at $0.50 each.

## Objective
The project aimed to establish a data-driven strategy for determining the optimal number of Quant Croissants to bake daily, considering both costs and variable customer demand.

## Code and Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.10 
* Packages: numpy, matplotlib, scipy.stats
* Project information: Rady Tasty Pastry by Terrence August

## Methodology:
* Analyzed historical sales data and identified demand variability for Quant Croissants.
* Modeled demand using a normal distribution with a mean of 535.279 and a standard deviation of 144.571.
* Developed a simulation model to identify the optimal production quantity (q) that maximizes profitability while mitigating the risk of surplus or shortage.

## Extension & Innovation:
Enhanced the model to incorporate price optimization alongside quantity, allowing Rady Tasty Pastry to adjust pricing according to demand fluctuations.
Created a dynamic function that inputs the price/demand relationship and calculates the optimal price point and production quantity, integrating a [Price/Demand Model].

## Results & Impact:
Enabled Rady Tasty Pastry to make informed decisions on production and pricing, leading to improved profit margins and reduced waste.
Provided a scalable model that can be adapted to changing market conditions and other product lines.
